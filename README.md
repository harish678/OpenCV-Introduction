# OpenCV-Introduction
### Introduction to OpenCV3
---------------------------

OpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library with bindings in C++, C, Python, and Java. OpenCV is used for all sorts of image and video analysis, like facial recognition and detection, license plate reading, photo editing, advanced robotic vision, optical character recognition, and a whole lot more.


### Install OpenCV
------------------

Along with the OpenCV we will be using Matplotlib and Numpy libraries in the Tutorials.

#### Windows Users:
[python-OpenCV](https://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/) - There are alternative methods, but this is the easiest. Download the appropriate wheel (.whl) file, and install using pip.

pip install numpy

pip install matplotlib

Not familiar with using pip? See the Pip installation tutorial for help.

#### Linux / Mac Users:
pip3 install numpy or apt-get install python3-numpy. You may need to apt-get install python3-pip.

pip3 install matplotlib or apt-get install python3-matplotlib.

apt-get install python3-OpenCV
